# revenuecat_package (Resource)

Manages a package within a RevenueCat offering. A package groups the equivalent products across
stores — for example the monthly subscription on both the App Store and the Play Store — so your
paywall can present one choice regardless of platform.

Attach products to a package with
[`revenuecat_package_product_attachment`](package_product_attachment.md).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "revenuecat_package" "monthly" {
  project_id   = data.revenuecat_project.main.id
  offering_id  = revenuecat_offering.default.id
  lookup_key   = "$rc_monthly"
  display_name = "Monthly"
  position     = 1
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `project_id` (String) Identifier of the project the package belongs to. Changing this forces a new package.
- `offering_id` (String) Identifier of the offering the package belongs to. Changing this forces a new package.
- `lookup_key` (String) Key used to reference the package from the RevenueCat SDKs, for example
  `$rc_monthly`. The API has no way to change this after creation, so changing it here forces a new package.
- `display_name` (String) Human-readable name of the package, shown in the RevenueCat dashboard. Required by the API.
- `position` (Number) Position of the package within its offering, used to order packages on a
  paywall. Optional on create, but the API requires it on every later update, so it is required here too.
  The create endpoint does not reliably honor the requested value — this resource detects the mismatch
  and issues a follow-up update to correct it, so the configured value is always what ends up in state.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) RevenueCat identifier of the package.
- `created_at` (Number) Creation time of the package, in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

## Import

Packages are imported with a `<project_id>:<offering_id>:<package_id>` identifier:

```shell
terraform import revenuecat_package.monthly proj1abc:ofrng1xyz:pkg1def
```
